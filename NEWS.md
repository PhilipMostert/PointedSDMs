# PointedSDMs 2.1.4

#### Changes and fixes since previous version:

-   `startSpecies` update: `speciesEnvironment` may now take the options: `'community'` which estimates a community and species-specific effects, `"stack"` which estimates species-specific effects or `'shared'` which estimates community effects.
-   Updates to reflect changes in *inlabru*.
-   Bug fixes across multiple functions.
-   Addition of new functions such as `assignCovariate` and `nearestValue` to assist with aligning covariate information and observation data.
